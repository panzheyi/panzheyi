[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"Dr. Zheyi Pan earned his Ph.D. degree at Apex Data \u0026amp; Knowledge Management Lab of Shanghai Jiaotong University in 2020, and got his B.Eng. degree from ACM Honored Class of Shanghai Jiaotong University in 2015, under the advisory of Prof. Yong Yu. His research interest lies in deep learning and data mining with a special focus on urban computing and spatio-temporal data. He has published several papers in top interational conferences and well-recognized journals, including KDD, CIKM, IEEE TKDE. He was an intern at Microsoft Research Asia and JD Intelligent Cities Research. He will join JD Doctor Management Trainee Program (DMT) in 2020.\nMy full CV is avaiable:\n  Chineses version (中文)  English version  ","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/zheyi-pan/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/zheyi-pan/","section":"authors","summary":"Dr. Zheyi Pan earned his Ph.D. degree at Apex Data \u0026amp; Knowledge Management Lab of Shanghai Jiaotong University in 2020, and got his B.Eng. degree from ACM Honored Class of","tags":null,"title":"Zheyi Pan","type":"authors"},{"authors":["Zheyi Pan","Songyu Ke","Xiaodu Yang","Yuxuan Liang","Yong Yu","Junbo Zhang","Yu Zheng"],"categories":["featured"],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"d9d5a93d49645f793f2c4eaac623ebe0","permalink":"/publication/pan2021autostg/","publishdate":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pan2021autostg/","section":"publication","summary":"WWW 2021","tags":["Neural architecture search","Spatio-temporal graph","Meta learning"],"title":"AutoSTG: Neural Architecture Search for Predictions of Spatio-Temporal Graphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zheyi Pan","Wentao Zhang","Yuxuan Liang","Weinan Zhang","Yong Yu","Junbo Zhang","Yu Zheng"],"categories":["featured"],"content":"","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588291200,"objectID":"9d21dfc5c409c100f09b412ed9ab8e92","permalink":"/publication/pan2020spatio/","publishdate":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pan2020spatio/","section":"publication","summary":"TKDE 2020","tags":["Urban traffic","Spatio-temporal data","Neural network","Meta learning"],"title":"Spatio-Temporal Meta Learning for Urban Traffic Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zheyi Pan","Zhaoyuan Wang","Weifeng Wang","Yong Yu","Junbo Zhang","Yu Zheng"],"categories":["featured"],"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"4e8630f03a945aa72cf9235d82dffae1","permalink":"/publication/pan2019matrix/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pan2019matrix/","section":"publication","summary":"**[ORAL]** CIKM 2019, Applied Data Science Track (acceptance rate: 21.8%)","tags":["Urban flow","Neural networks","Matrix factorization"],"title":"Matrix Factorization for Spatio-Temporal Neural Networks with Applications to Urban Flow Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zheyi Pan","Jie Bao","Weinan Zhang","Yong Yu","Yu Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"5a0ea2e4bac6a2907153bd6d921adac1","permalink":"/publication/pan2019trajguard/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pan2019trajguard/","section":"publication","summary":"KDD 2019, Applied Data Science Track (acceptance rate: 20.7%)","tags":["Trajectory data","Copyright protection"],"title":"TrajGuard: A Comprehensive Trajectory Copyright Protection Scheme","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zheyi Pan","Yuxuan Liang","Weifeng Wang","Yong Yu","Yu Zheng","Junbo Zhang"],"categories":["featured"],"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"eb11fec0de0a34a75b5b1816f3cc3a70","permalink":"/publication/pan2019urban/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pan2019urban/","section":"publication","summary":"**[ORAL]** KDD 2019, Research Track (acceptance rate: 14.2%)","tags":["Urban traffic","Spatio-temporal data","Neural network","Meta learning"],"title":"Urban Traffic Prediction from Spatio-Temporal Data Using Deep Meta Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chieh-Jan Mike Liang","Börje F.
